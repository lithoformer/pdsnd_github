### Project Title
**Explore Bikeshare Data**

### Description
The project was to create a python script to explore bike rental data for three cities, namely Chicago, New York City, and Washington.  The user is prompted for the city, months, and weekdays to filter the data and is also given the option to view the raw data 5 rows at a time.  Finally, the script computes statistics upon the filtered data and displays them to the user.

The script can be run using the following command:

`python test.py`

### Files used

### Credits
